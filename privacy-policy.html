<h1>RIVO — Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="last-updated">Last Updated: February 21, 2026</p>

<p>RIVO ("we," "our," or "the app") is a personal food and drink journal application. We take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use the RIVO app.</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>

<p><strong>Data You Create:</strong> RIVO allows you to log meals, drinks, desserts, coffee, snacks, and cocktail recipes. This includes entry names, locations, ratings, photos, notes, tags, and any other content you choose to add. This data is stored locally on your device and, if you enable iCloud sync, in your personal iCloud account.</p>

<p><strong>Location Data:</strong> When you log an entry with a location, RIVO uses your device's location services to help you search for and select places. Location data is only used within the app to display your entries on a map. We do not collect, transmit, or store your location data on any external servers.</p>

<p><strong>Purchase Information:</strong> If you subscribe to RIVO Premium, your purchase is processed entirely by Apple through the App Store. We use RevenueCat to manage subscription status. RevenueCat receives an anonymous app user ID to verify your subscription — no personal information such as your name, email, or payment details is shared with us or RevenueCat.</p>

<h2>Data Storage</h2>

<p>All of your journal entries, recipes, photos, and personal data are stored locally on your device. If you enable iCloud sync, your data is also stored in your personal iCloud account, which is governed by Apple's privacy policy. We do not operate any servers that store your personal data.</p>

<h2>Data We Do NOT Collect</h2>

<p>We want to be clear about what we do not do:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We do not collect your name, email address, or any personal identification information.</li>
  <li>We do not track your browsing activity or app usage for advertising purposes.</li>
  <li>We do not sell, share, or rent your data to any third parties.</li>
  <li>We do not use any advertising SDKs or ad tracking tools.</li>
  <li>We do not use analytics tools that collect personally identifiable information.</li>
  <li>We do not access your camera or photo library without your explicit permission.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

<p><strong>Apple (App Store & iCloud):</strong> Purchases and optional cloud sync are handled by Apple. Their privacy policy applies to those services.</p>

<p><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> We use RevenueCat solely to manage subscription status. RevenueCat receives only an anonymous identifier and your subscription status. You can read RevenueCat's privacy policy at <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank">revenuecat.com/privacy</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Apple Maps:</strong> The map feature in RIVO uses Apple Maps. Apple's privacy policy governs how map data is handled.</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

<p>RIVO is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any information from children under 13.</p>

<h2>Data Deletion</h2>

<p>Since all data is stored on your device (and optionally in your iCloud account), you have full control over your data at all times. You can delete individual entries within the app, or delete all data by uninstalling the app. To remove iCloud data, you can manage this through your device's iCloud storage settings.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>

<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

<h2>Contact Us</h2>
